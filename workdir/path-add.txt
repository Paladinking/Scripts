Usage: path-add.exe [ARG]...
Goes through paths.txt and adds all matching lines.

Lines in paths.txt can have 3 different formats:
 1. {PATH}|{NAME}
  If {NAME} matches an input argument, {PATH} will be added to PATH environment variable.
  Note that | is a literal and should be present in the file.
 2. {CHILD}<{NAME}
  If {NAME} matches an input argument, add {CHILD} next in argument list.
  This can (but does not have to) cause infinite recursion for bad input, causing the program to run out of memory.
 3. {FILE}>{NAME}
  If {NAME} matches an input argument, parse {FILE} for environment variables.

All other lines are ignored.

Lines in an environment variable file given by format 3 in paths.txt can have 5 different formats:
 1. !!{VAR}
  Stop parsing file if {VAR} is defined.
 2. **{TEXT}
  {TEXT} is printed to the console.
 3. {PATH}|{VAR}
  {PATH} will be prepended to the environment variable {VAR}, separated by semi-colons.
 4. {VALUE}>{VAR}
  The environment variable {VAR} will be set to {VALUE}.
  Just >{VAR} is allowed and will delete the environment variable {VAR}.
 5. {TO_SAVE}<{VAR}
  The environment variable {VAR} will be set to the value in {TO_SAVE}.
  This is usefull for saving and restoring environment variables.
  

All other lines are again ignored.
